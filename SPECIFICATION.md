# SPECIFICATION

CHALO Product Specification

* Scope. This Chalo Product Specification is intended to cover the features essential to the success of the MVP.
* User Stories. The stories of users activity that must be met cover the key flows in the product.
  * An anonymous user can visit chalo.digital and find the waiting period of a car they are interested in. This waiting period should be available by zipcode across India. In order to define the car, the make / brand, the car , and the variant must be specified.
  * An anonymous user can signup for an account. This account can be used to register interest or declare intent-to-buy. The list of all available anonymized users (dapper-drake-1074 etc) and their intent-to-buys are publicly available information in Chalo, to be made visible on a specific page.
  * An admin account is needed for internal Operations staff to update the waiting period of various variants on a real time basis.
  * There is no way for individual users to add waiting periods in the MVP.
  * Once the waiting period for a variant is obtained, the page should provide shareable link options for users to share via WhatsApp. The page must be formatted in such a manner so as to provide WhatsApp compatible link sharing functionality. The waiting period itself should not be a part of the surfaced part of the URL in the Whatsapp Chat â€“ thereby driving traffic to the website upon clicking. 
* Rapid iteration with Git flow basics must be followed with proper testing and readable code in Github repo of BID.
